## What is REACT? 

– REACT is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces



---


## How REACT works?

** – React replaces all DOM/ jQuery elements: replace add event listeners and query selectors**

– React renders your components to the page

– If your data changes, React **automatically** re-renders your components

– **It also updates all the children components**

– The chart belows shows where REACT position is:

- React is JS UI: instead of writing DOM elements or method, REACT is put in place to do the same job, which create elements and transfer them to DOM, and get event listeners back and apply JS logic to our project

– REACT handles the UI from JS
